# Smart_Home
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kuldeep252/Smart_Home/master/Home1.jpg)This project is modeled over arduino Uno and tries to recreate a house environment in presence of automtion.  It uses 3 sensors which provides input along with bluetooth transmitter/receiver.The output is delivered via servo motors and LED lights which controls the respective operations.Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MvSyy1kmfc) to watch the video (sorry for noises in Audio)

## prerequisite
 
### Hardware

 *  Arduino Uno
 *  LED lights
 *  [LDR](https://www.amazon.in/LDR-Light-Dependent-Register-resistor/dp/B018LJPI76/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1512967276&sr=8-2&keywords=ldr) 
 *  [SG 90 Micro Servo](https://www.amazon.in/TowerPro-SG90-9g-Mini-Servo/dp/B076HP5MY1?tag=googinhydr18418-21&tag=googinkenshoo-21&ascsubtag=6f770f62-14d1-4016-a1b4-5fcfa200632e)
 *  [HC-05 Bluetooth Module](https://www.amazon.in/CENTIoT-Bluetooth-Transceiver-Module-Output/dp/B01LZTZVGQ?tag=googinhydr18418-21&tag=googinkenshoo-21&ascsubtag=6f770f62-14d1-4016-a1b4-5fcfa200632e)
 *  Connector wires
### Software
 *  Arduino IDE
 *  [MIT app creator](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/)


## Getting Started
 Connection for each pin is given in the program.Few images of the house are also attached with this repository.
 MIT app creater was used for development of android application.![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kuldeep252/Smart_Home/master/screenshot.jpg)The app transmits the signal(alphanumeric code) to the bluetooth module,
 which it feeds to program where decoding of the signal takes place and operations are made accordingly.
